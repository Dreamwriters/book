##Chapter 1

Ravek slammed his work knife between the crustacean and the rockface.  Gripping the handle with both hands, he grunted and twisted the blade, causing the strange creature to slowly peel away from the Bulwark wall.  He readjusted his grip and quickly levered up, freeing the solvak with a wet squealch, falling into the net below.  Ravek dropped the knife, tied to his belt by a short cord, and inspected his hands for signs of solvak slime or sting, looking between his fingers, in the creases of the knuckles, and under the fingernails as he was taught.  On his fourth round of checking, Ravek froze: on the outside of his right little finger, a bead of blood.  He shivered.  He whipped open the pouch at his belt and pulled out the last of his kadi leaf, stuffing the wad of precious blue arrowhead shapes into his mouth with hand shaking.  After chewing the pungent leaves for a few seconds, he bit the inside of his cheek hard until he tasted blood and pushed the leaf mass against the wound with his tongue.  Eyes closed, Ravek swung from the harness rope and listened to his heartbeat pulsing in his ears, drowning out the ocean waves and sea wind.  He didn’t know how long he hung, suspended over the surf, but eventually his pulse slowed and breathing steadied and deepened.

His eyes finally drifted open, and he looked down to his right hand, clenching and releasing it, analyzing the sting’s effects.

*Numb, but no shooting pains.  Grip still strong enough to climb, but not without care.*

It had been months since Ravek had been poisoned by a solvak, and he had allowed himself to get careless.  He looked down into the net below where the the offending creature still waved diminutive legs, feebly trying to escape its unusual prison.  He grimaced, wondering which of the many retracting spines on the solvak’s underside had shot out and jabbed him.  He reached over to the knot tying the harness rope to himself and loosened it and lowered himself down to the net.  Secured to the cliff face by sharpened poles wedged into cracks that scrawled across the Bulwark face, he had strung the net between them prior to the encounter.  Ravek braced himself against the wall and worked loose first one pole and then the other, bringing them together to form a sack with the slovak clicking at him furiously inside.  He swung the netted slovak hard at the rock wall, bouncing off due to its hard spiny carapace, gray and white to blend into the Bulwark.  Stunned, the creature ceased its frenzy and lay still.  Ravek smirked in satisfaction.

A jet of the sea sprayed up the wall several hundred feet from a strong wave striking it, soaking his legs.  Tying off the net and poles to his belt to hang below him, he twisted his eyes down to the increasing power of the surf and then the position of the sun in the sky.

“Flotsam”, he muttered.

He judged he had been waiting for the poison to wear off for an hour or so, significantly longer than he planned to hunt slovak.  Based on the sun and surf, there was perhaps fifteen minutes before the Breath arrived, and then he would be nothing but another soul lost to the giant boulders and sharp rocks below, the Bulwark’s Tears.  He needed to move quickly.

His gear secured, he began the arduous process of climbing up the remaining nine hundred feet of rock encumbered and weakened.  He had long been conditioned to the ascent, but his hand was still unfeeling.  Reaching up with his right hand, he visually confirmed the rope in its grip, willing it to close tightly, and he waited until his knuckles were white before trusting to its strength.  In a few minutes, he felt the headache begin, a locus of pain in his temples.  He stretched his left arm out to a knob on the wall and gripped it.  The tendons in his hand ached with fatigue and quivered with strain.  The edges of his breath began to taste metallic.  Louder still than his gasps was the growing thunder from the waves falling onto the cliff face below.

There.  To the right was a ledge above him that was deep enough to rest on.  Carefully, he pulled himself towards it, handhold to foothold, and hooked his hands onto the lip of the rock and heaved himself onto it until one of the lines hanging from his belt jerked tight and held him short of safety.  The netted slovak had managed to work a few legs into cracks in the Bulwark, trying to fully seat himself on the wall before the Breath.

Pulling mightily, his vision momentarily blurry, Ravek wrenched himself upward and ripped the slovak free, collapsing onto the rock ledge and croaking air into burning lungs.  The Bulwark rattled beneath him as the ocean roared against it, and fear spidered through him.  He twisted to look seaward, and nausea churned his stomach.  Not much time.  He looked upward.  A hundred and fifty feet.  He massaged his numbed hand with his other, aching hand and looked down to his prize.

"Flotsam and jetsam!" he shouted into the wind, the words whipped to sea.  He jerked his head to study the route to safety above, searching for secure handholds and footholds.  He narrowed the options to the one he could wedge his near useless hand into a vertical crack for the remainder of the climb up, which on any other day would have been a poor choice.  He pushed himself to his feet, putting his back to the wall and palms flat against it and looked out to the tempest.  The insistant waves plunged over themselves to get to the Bulwark, roaring their disdain of land before being thrown back and replaced by their brothers.  He curled his numb hand into a fist, tighter and tighter until it shook.  He still couldn't feel it.

Ravek dropped to his knees and pulled up his knife and sawed through the line to the slovak, and watched it tumble down into the churning foam below.  He turned back to the wall for the remainder of the ascent.  Lighter and unhindered, he followed the crack he had seen up to top of the Bulwark at a speed just short of reckless, his arms shaking, his numb hand getting scraped and wrenched by its rough treatment.  Finally he levered himself onto the top and flopped onto his back, jolted by sudden joy to have escaped the Breath in time but quickly replaced by despair over the cost.  He sat up and looked over the froth of the ocean below and his lip curled into a sneer.  

The ocean takes everything in time, they say.  Not even the land itself can hold it at bay forever.  It had taken his parents when he was too young to remember, but being a sea urchin wasn't unusual.  He had his grandfather and uncle to raise him.  First his grandfather had died, then his uncle perished on the river.  Alone at 14, he would make his grandfather proud for carrying on like a man and taking care of himself.  He wouldn't moan and wail like a woman.

Alone.

Rage boiled up inside him and filled his veins.  He leapt to his feet and unleashed a primal scream into the stinging wind, then taken and engulfed by the deep voice of the ocean's rage, matching his own feeble attempts.  He paced the wall with aggressive strides, shouting at the uncaring sea.  The Bulwark shook under the ocean's onslaught, knocking him down, but that just enraged him further.  He slammed his numb hand against the ground again and again, grinding his teeth, until he could feel the pain.

Laughing maniacially, Ravek fought the bucking ground under him and tottered to his feet, throwing up a gashed and bloody fist triumphantly above him like a trophy.  The Breath approached, a monstrous wave that made all the previous ones mere ripples in comparison.  Even from the height of the Bulwark, its size was incomprehensibly half as tall as the cliff itself.  Unrushed and stately, it rolled forward.  As long as the wall.

"Take me!  I'm right here waiting for you!"

The Breath met the wall with a deafening crash, the Bulwark screaming in a way stone should not.  A wall of water frothed with foam and filled with everything the Breath could snatch from the sea eagerly shot up and towered above the Bulwark hundreds of feet in the air, an impossible hand ready to slap down and crush everything foolish enough to stand in its way.  Then it rushed down, mercifully sparing the madman.  The Bulwark rumbled, and a huge chunk of the clifface to Ravek's left groaned and fell away to the sea in a tremendous rush, a fresh Tear shed from rocky face of the Bulwark.

"So close!  So close!  You'll have to try again another time, Sea Father!" Ravek giggled.  Soaked with spray, he gathered up his lines and supplies, and he turned to follow the path back to Watch, empty handed.  Alone.
