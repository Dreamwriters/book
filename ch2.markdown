#Chapter 2
His feet slapped against the hard flinty stone atop the Bulwark.  The rock itself was quite beautiful if one could take the time from surviving to appreciate it.  All hard planes and sharp angles, it drifted from dusty gray to night black with small dots of crystal taking the light and flicking it back into your eyes.  Between various shades it was veined in a deep, black, red.  There was a reason why even small pieces of the Bulwark's Tears were valuable throughout the softlands, used in jewelry, bowls, combs, knife handles, mantlepieces, doors, and columns.  It was rumored that some lords built their manors with huge amounts of the material, and that a softland king had constructed his entire throne room of the stuff.

"Fish guts," Ravek muttered, kicking a loose chunk of the glittering Bulwark off the edge, worth at least a week of labor if sold inland.  The problem wasn't getting it.  The Breath ensured an endless supply.  It was so heavy and difficult to transport that few could trade it downriver fast enough or in sufficient quantities to be profitable.  Those that managed had become wealthy, but the initial investment had destroyed more than a few years of scrimping and saving from those who had attempted it.  The vessel to carry it was expensive, the trip into the Veins perilous, and the captains both brave enough and experienced enough to accomplish it were rare and expensive to hire.  Ultimately, that meant that he stood on a mountain of wealth just as accessible as the seabed itself.

He sighed and looked to the ocean, a sheet of blue to the horizon.  The Breath spent, the sea had pulled back to gather itself for its next assault on the Bulwark.  He had chosen to make his way through slovak hunting.  The creatures were easy to transport and sold well in Watch for high prices, but were considered too dangerous to gather alive.  It was the task of children to scamper over the rocks searching for dead slovak to sell for praise and rewards.  Unfortunately, the slovak's death starts souring the venom, ruining the meat and rendering it unusable for the physicks.  Capturing them alive allowed him to sell them for six times higher than usual, but came with the risk of being lanced with the potent slovak poison.

Needles of pain began to pop and crawl through his hand.  Ravek grumbled under his breath, grabbing his hand and rubbing as if to push them out of his veins.  It had been a long time since he had last been stung, and he had forgotten how uncomfortable it was.  The numbness is the true danger of the venom.  First it numbed the mind with a lethargic delerium, then paralysis of the body, and stilling the lungs.  Most victims panic then, eyes rolling and darting, tears leaking, they suffocate.  All sea urchins are warned of it, and those that see it occur are never children again.

No more kadi leaf left, he thought.  He pulled open his pouch and dropped his hand inside, pulling his fingertips along the bottom seam hoping to feel more hidden blue leaves inside.  Nothing.  A soft whimper slipped out of his lips before he could squish it.

Ravek plodded forward, exhausted by his toils of the day, not looking forward to Calepo's questions.

Eventually, the top of the Bulwark gave way to open plains on his left hand and open sea to his right.  He began climbing the slate stone to reveal Watch looming below him.  It was an impressive redoubt of stone, carved into the rock of the Bulwark itself.  Housing, shops, stalls, streets, paths, all were cut deeply, though crudely.  Tunnels entered the cliffside and appeared elsewhere.  Rope bridges spanned the empty spaces to connect streets between undulations of the cliff.  Ladders went from housing below to new streets above.  Children scampered along cliffedges and bucking rope bridges while screaming and throwing rocks.  Watch grew around an opening in the Bulwark, guarding the river known as the Artery, which as it flowed into the continent branched out into the Veins, connecting many inland towns, cities, and fortresses of the inlanders.  In the center of the mouth of the Artery as it opened to the sea, a gigantic statue loomed, features long since worn away.  It was known locally as the First Fisherman, but inlanders called it the Sentinel.  He stood on his pedestal with head lifted to sea and lifting up a massive lantern.  The First Fisherman was hollow, and Watch had been keeping the beacon in his lantern lit every night since time immemorial, guiding ocean faring vessels to the only water passage inland.

Ravek continued along the top of the Bulwark until coming about the western gate into Watch, a slope down into the stone leading to a raised portcullis.  He eyed the spikes above him as he passed underneath, scurrying under the barbed tips of that steel maw.  He halted under the gaze of the guard casually blocking his way.  The guard snorted.

"Not a good catch today, eh Ravek?  In fact, I'd say you came back with less than you left with," his eyes rolled to make contact with his fellow through a window in the stone wall and shared a laugh.

"Let me go," Ravek said, eyes affixed to the cracked leather of the guardsman's boots.

"I don't know, should we let people in who lose nets?" He leaned in, mirth vanishing like the Breath itself.  The fish leather armor he wore gave off a distinct musty smell.

"I paid for it," Ravek's eyes met the guard's, a scowl twisting the boy's face.

"Well, he paid for it, he says.  I 'spose it's fine to throw away perfectly good nets then if you've *paid* for it.  The Fishermen will overlook that, won't they Ravek?" he said, leaning back with a matching scowl.

"No, they won't," he said, voice soft and eyes again on the leather boots.  They were in need of polish.

"Well then, I wouldn't want to speak for Fishermen, but were I you I would think of a good story.  No, actually I would think it would be better to think of a way to attone.  Yeah, skip the story, lad," the guard said and snorted, stepping to the side for Ravek to squeeze by.

"Thanks," Ravek said to the guard's boots.  He descended down into the rough-hewn tunnel and started humming once the guards were lost to the twists and turns of Watch's caverns.  He checked his gear, and winced thinking of how he would need to explain the lack of a catch as well as his lack of a net.  Plants grew poorly on the Bulwark.  Soil never lasted long on the cliffs, and anything that tried to put its tendrils into that stony ediface was ripped out by the constant power of the Breath.  The people of Watch had difficulty acquiring material for netting.
