A large statue of a man facing the sea on top of a rocky outcropping in the mouth of the Artery. He is several hundred feet tall, bearded, with a robe being blown back behind him. His face is obscurred due to erosion. He holds aloft a massive stone lantern with open sides in his right hand. His left arm is thrust back behind him as if to hold himself forward against the push of the [[Breath]]. The inside of the statue is hollow, and has a staircase within to allow access from the base up to his lantern. There are several [ropeways](ropeways) that connect from each side of Watch to some of the lower portions of the statue, allowing access. The rock on which he stands is jagged and is a dangerous obstacle to any ships.
