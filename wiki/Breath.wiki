The Breath is a massive tsunami wave that strikes the [[Bulwark]] throughout the week at irregular intervals. Its source is unknown. The force of the Breath is strong enough to rip sections off of the Bulwark called the Bulwark's [[Tears]]. The Breath has far-reaching consequences not only for those living in [Watch](Watch) but also those deep into the continent. The Breath will push seawater deep into the [[Artery]] and onward into the [Veins](Veins). The obvious counterpoint to the Breath is the [[Inhale]]. The Breath comes in as a straight massive many-hundred-feet-tall super wave that strikes the Bulwark simultaneously everywhere. Certain spots of the Bulwark are resistant to its damaging effects, such as Watch.
