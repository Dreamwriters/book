Cliffroads are a [[watch:slang|slang]] word for the flattened cliff walls of Watch. These are distinguished specifically from [[rockroads]] and [[ropeways]]. Cliffroads are high-value due to the views they provide, and tend to support more traffic due to being wider. The are crenalated on the side over the drop, and sloped in such a way that water flows down a cliffroad, to one side of a cliffroad and into a channel, or both. Cliffroads are treated as roads, but they were designed as they are for defensive purposes.
