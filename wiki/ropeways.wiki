These are effectively [en wikipedia wiki Simple_suspension_bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_suspension_bridge). They use no wood, as that is rare and valuable. As such, they are carefully cared for due to the [[watch:rope|lack of fiberous plants]], and serve to connect the various parts of Watch together, reducing the need to tunnel through the hard [[Bulwark]]. They are strongly made, and support many people on it at once, to a point. It is common for a heavily used ropeway to be one-directional to reduce bumping and slowdowns and for lighter use ropeways to be bi-directional. The bidirectional bridges have created a culture of less personal space, as people need to squeeze past one another without throwing themselves against the side of the bridge and causing unsteadiness.

Due to the history of wartime use of Watch and the needs of protecting bridges from the [[Breath]], ropeways are rapidly cleared, disconnected on a side, and wound up on the other. When the bridge is raised, a thrower will hurl a stone attached to a light and thin line, caught be the other side, and this is used to string the bridge once again. They have become so used to this rapid deconstruction and reconstruction of the bridges that it's second nature to the society.
