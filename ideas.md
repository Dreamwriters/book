##Book ideas that may be fun
Epic fantasy where the fate of the world or nation is NOT at stake
Tragic book where the hero fails and somehow staying satisfying

##Character ideas that are neato
Character doesn’t know what goals to have in life, can’t decide for themselves

##Setting ideas that appeal
Culture where children are commodities, sold into slavery, very little parental connection
No wind in world
Extreme tectonic activity, mountains and things appearing and disappearing in real time.
Matriarchial dominated societies
Rock grows, wood is rare
Everyone disfigured
Stars are somehow collected/consumed as a resource
Seismic cultural shifts occurring very fast
People grow into immaturity, benjamin button maturation (as in attitude, not physical)
Loving someone negatively affects you and/or them


##Plot thoughts 
Hero becomes the dark lord
	Path to hell paved with good intentions
	Cheer on the dark lord, hate the hero
Elfish race goes from diminishing to flourishing
Story built around the Gandalf character instead of the hero
	could be told as if it’s a high fantasy but from Gandalf perspective
	hero fails/corrupted, must find new hero
Story from the dark lord’s perspective as he is defeated by the hero


##Cool magic things
Cutting/melding
	yin-yang type system where you can arbitrarily divide things and bind things together
Incantation based
	old school vibe focused around the words said
Costs life length
Attributes (life, strength, intelligence) become economic commodities
Air from different regions bottled and used to fuel economy/magics
	Air from different regions released into foreign regions causes things to occur
Information told by others is forgotten by the teller
Light itself is the currency to use a magic
	Darken the sun?
	Increases ambient light?



##Tidal waters book
Very strong tidal variations from the moon?  Tie in to magics?
	Revealed cave systems that contain something valuable, creating a timetable to escape
		what could be valuable inside the caves?  Replenished via water rising?
			valuable minerals/crystals/mcguffins revealed by erosion
		Criminal hideouts?
		Large predators
	Ocean side deep canyons where, when tide comes in, slams into cliffs and blasts into the river systems
	Settlements in cliff walls carved out by powerful water erosion
	Verticle shafts in cliff walls where boats can rise and fall like canal locks
	Plot:  Calamity where the tides stop coming in, or come in even stronger, doing economic or physical damage
	Deep upriver lands get fresh water and irrigate with it, coastal side more trade, transport
	Islands and other land masses submerge/reemerge with the tide
	Breath of Poseidon/god
	Animal/plant life built around life-cycle of tides, attachment to rocks, transport upstream, armored against the force
	Cave systems maze-like and dangerous, partially underwater, oxygen 
	some tides come in extremely forcefully, others powerfully but gradually
	tides come in every day
		more dynamic, exciting
	tides come in seasonally, once a week, etc. but less frequently
		gradual flow back to sea, fed by upriver lakes filled by fast tide surges
		more exciting because of inconstancy
		can be cyclical, high tide in, low tide out, dry when lakes no longer reach level to drain
	difficult to bridge tidal rivers because of erosion, strong currents, changing flows
		Difficult to travel across the land because of numerous waterways, all leading to the coast
	Large salt deposits from seawater being pushed upriver
	Land desalinates river as it is pushed upstream
		can tell distance from coast by tasting the water
			different meaning depending on which way the river flows
	Sailing the tidal rivers
		Destructive tides necessitate protected harbors
	Land breaks off in large chunks through erosion
	Storms amplify the tide
	Freshwater on top of seawater
	Cliffs of dover-like interface to ocean
		land slowly being erroded over time, fishermen priests protecting something that fell into the sea due to erosion
		
Magics
	moon-influenced
		gravity/telekinesis power to parallel tidal world?
	water connected
		water bending! lol
	
Coast bases tax inland goods traveling through, must be repaired constantly because of powerful erosion forces
	have alarm system (bell, horn) to warn of incoming tide
	highly defensible, castle-like
		invasion possibility protected by position
		kingdoms divided by river entrances from sea, branching back to inland, divided by what is connected to what river mouth
	extremely tall canyon entrance, allows rope bridges between sides
		bridges retracted before tide?
Large river deltas on coast, alternative to tall cliff version
		rich soils, amazing agriculture
Where river and sea meet: estuary
	bays, harbors, lagoons, inlets, or sounds
Religion based around huge tide giving and taking
Mermaid people
Pirate people/oceanfaring race
	somehow deals with huge tides safely
Characters
	kid in cliff town (name?)
		intro to book, doing things, hears alarm, gets to vantage to watch the tide roll in, spectacular
		ocean-son
			parents killed by/lost in sea/tide

		plot:mystery, how did parents actually die?
			rumors that they were murdered, crossed with the political authorities
			killed supernaturally in connection with god/priesthood/fishermen
			dad found out secret about fishermen, killed for it?
	fisherman character
		gandalf to kid
			could be unwilling, but heart of gold forces him to care for kid, comes to see him as a son
			could have been looking out for the kid the whole time, friend of father? knew something about death?

		rebel of fishermen, outcast, but still a part of the order
			hates fishermen because of dark secret thing they do
